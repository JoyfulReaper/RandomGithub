RandomGithub
============

Ridiculous way to find random githubs!  
Who needs a simple webscript to find random githubs? Not you! You need full fledged C++ program, and you have found it! This program uses the github API to present you whith a list of random repos with some information such as the owner and a short description.  

There are two binary files:  
randomGithub (console version)  
and  
gtkRandomGithub (GTK version)  

use make to build. Uses a stupid handcoded make file, it requires pkg-config
